    "\n",
    "2. **Incorrect OTP Entry (Ones):**\n",
    "   - Generate an OTP.\n",
    "   - Enter an incorrect 6-digit numeric OTP.\n",
    "   - Expected Outcome: Incorrect OTP, n attempts left.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incorrect OTP Entry (Max Attempts):**\n",
    "   - Generate an OTP.\n",
    "   - Enter incorrect 6-digit numeric OTP for all attempts.\n",
    "   - Expected Outcome: You have exceeded maximum attempts. Access Denied!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Invalid OTP Entry (Non-Digit Characters):**\n",
    "   - Generate an OTP.\n",
    "   - Enter alphabetic characters or special characters instead of digits.\n",
    "   - Expected Outcome: Prompt for re-entry of OTP with an appropriate error message.\n",

    "5. **Invalid OTP Entry (Incorrect Length):**\n",
    "   - Generate an OTP.\n",
    "   - Enter an OTP with fewer or more than 6 digits.\n",
